Create a simple webpage with a single button on it. The text in the button should say "I've been clicked 0 times".
When the user clicks on the button, two things should happen: The button's text should update to reflect the number
of times it has been clicked. So, after being clicked once, it should say "I've been clicked 1 time." After being
clicked twice, it should say "I've been clicked two times".
Each time the button is clicked, a new button should be added to the page. It should say "I've been clicked 0 times.
(It's a new button, so it hasn't been clicked yet). Each button added to the page should have the same interactions
as the first button. Clicking it increments its value and creates a new button on the page.
When you check your work, make sure that after n button clicks on the page, the sum of all buttons' counters should
be n, and there should be n+1 buttons on the page.
